      <h2>Motive Behind This?</h2>
      <p>
        So the motive behind creating our website or community is to empower web
        developers with the necessary resources and support they need to excel
        in their field. We want to provide a one-stop destination for all the
        resources that a developer needs to build a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it's simple and very clear now, I'm also a developer like you
        all and finding resources for projects are a very tough task. So, I
        decided to do something for the community and make it easier for
        everyone to find resources for their projects. I hope you all will like
        it. ðŸ˜„
